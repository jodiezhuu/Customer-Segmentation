Customer segmentation uses unsupervised machine learning to divide customers into common characteristics based on its optimal number of clusters and generates a three-dimensional model that displays consumer profiles.

In order to help companies and businesses understand their targeted customers, it is important that such businesses have a thorough understanding of how their consumers use their services.

For instance, Testla's segmentation encaptures income levels, life-style, and age demographics. (https://research-methodology.net/tesla-segmentation-targeting-and-positioning-overview/).
